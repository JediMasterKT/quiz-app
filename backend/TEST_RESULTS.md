# Quiz App Test Results Summary

## 🟢 Working Features (5/10 tests passing)

### ✅ Authentication System
- **Registration**: Users can register with username, email, and password
  - Password validation: Must be 8+ chars with uppercase, lowercase, and number
- **Login**: Users can login with username OR email + password
  - Returns JWT token for authenticated requests
- **Health Check**: Server is responding correctly

### ✅ Basic Statistics
- **Update Stats**: Can record game statistics (limited functionality)
- **Leaderboard**: Endpoint responds (but no data due to missing tables)

## 🔴 Not Working (5/10 tests failing)

### ❌ User Profile
- **Get User Info**: Returns wrong data structure
- Issue: Profile endpoint not returning expected format

### ❌ Progression System
- **Get Progression**: Database tables missing
- **Calculate XP**: Service errors due to missing tables
- **Add XP**: Cannot update non-existent user fields
- Issue: Migrations failed for XP levels, achievements, user statistics tables

### ❌ Categories
- **Get Categories**: Returns wrong format
- Issue: Categories endpoint not properly implemented

## 🐛 Root Causes

1. **Database Migration Failures**
   - Several migrations failed to run (game sessions, achievements, XP levels)
   - Missing tables: `xp_levels`, `achievements`, `user_achievements`, `user_statistics`, `leaderboard_entries`
   - Some existing tables missing required columns

2. **API Inconsistencies**
   - Login initially required email only (fixed)
   - Profile endpoint format doesn't match expectations
   - Categories endpoint not returning array

3. **No Pre-Testing**
   - Code was written but never tested before user handoff
   - Integration tests only created after user reported issues

## 📝 Lessons Learned

1. **Always write tests FIRST** - Test-driven development prevents these issues
2. **Run integration tests** before declaring "complete"
3. **Validate database migrations** succeed before proceeding
4. **Test the actual UI** not just the code
5. **Document password requirements** clearly in the UI

## 🔧 To Fix

1. Fix database migrations or create simpler schema
2. Add proper integration test suite
3. Validate all endpoints work end-to-end
4. Test UI flows before handoff
5. Add better error messages and validation feedback
